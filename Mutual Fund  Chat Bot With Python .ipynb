    "Creating a mutual fund-oriented chatbot in Python requires a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a well-structured handling of mutual fund related queries, and possibly integration with a financial data API for real-time information. Below is a simplified version that utilizes basic Python structure and logic. This chatbot will be able to handle a few common user queries regarding mutual funds."

    "# How the Chatbot Works:\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot initializes with predefined greetings, a list of mutual fund types, a dictionary of common questions and responses, and farewells.\n",
    "Greeting and Farewells:\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot greets the user upon starting. It will respond with a random greeting each time. Similarly, it says farewell with a random message when the user decides to exit.\n",
    "Handling Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot listens for user input and responds to predefined questions. For any query that isnâ€™t recognized, it provides a fallback message.\n",
    "Possible Outputs:\n",
    "User Input: \"What are mutual funds?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot Response: \"Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from many investors to purchase securities like stocks and bonds.\"\n",
    "User Input: \"What types of mutual funds are there?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot Response: \"The common types of mutual funds are: Equity Fund, Debt Fund, Hybrid Fund, Index Fund, Sector Fund.\"\n",
    "User Input: \"How to invest in mutual funds?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot Response: \"You can invest in mutual funds through a financial advisor, directly through the fund house, or through online platforms.\"\n",
    "User Input: \"Tell me about SIP.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot Response: \"I'm sorry, I don't have information on that. Can you ask something else?\"\n",
    "User Input: \"exit\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot Response: \"Goodbye! Hope I helped you with your queries.\"\n",
    "Future Improvements:\n",
    "Natural Language Processing: To understand more varied queries.\n",
    "Integration with Financial APIs: For real-time data on mutual funds, NAVs, etc.\n",
    "User Profiles: To provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.\n",
    "Logging and Analytics: To analyze user interactions for better performance and training.\n",
    "This basic framework can be expanded and improved based on specific user needs and capabilities required for a full mutual fund chatbot"
